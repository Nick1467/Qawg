# QAWG Experiment Compiler

`QAWG` is a host-side experiment compiler for the Tektronix AWG5208 and
ATS9371 stack in this repository.

The package owns the complete hardware stack:

```text
QAWG/
    awg5200/       Waveform, marker, sequence, and AWG5208 driver
    alazar/        ATS9371 acquisition and signal processing
    awg_alazar.py  AWG/Alazar execution coordinator
    compiler.py    Experiment rules and compiled sequence plan
    examples.py    Spectroscopy, Power Rabi, T1, and single-shot programs
```

Common imports:

```python
from QAWG import AWGAlazar, ExperimentProgram
from QAWG.awg5200 import gaussian_square_ns, waveform
from QAWG.alazar import AlazarProcessor
```

## Hardware vs experiment configuration

Connection-time settings describe fixed hardware capabilities:

```python
experiment = AWGAlazar.connect(
    "TCPIP0::192.168.10.171::inst0::INSTR",
    awg_sample_rate_hz=2.5e9,
    alazar_sample_rate_hz=1e9,
    acquire_window_s=1.5 * us,
    trigger_slope="rising",
    trigger_level=140,
)
```

`acquire_window_s` is the maximum raw ATS record requested for every shot.
It is independent of IQ integration.

`trigger_slope` and `trigger_level` are fixed ATS external-trigger electrical
settings. `trigger_level` is the Alazar SDK threshold code from 0 to 255, not
a voltage value.

Readout processing settings belong to each experiment declaration:

```python
self.declare_readout(
    "ro",
    adc_channel=cfg["adc_channel"],
    length=cfg["ro_len"],
    demod_freq=cfg["f_res"],
    waveform_ch=cfg["res_ch"],
    marker_padding=500 * ns,
    integrate_time=cfg["integrate_time"],
)
```

ATS trigger configuration belongs in the program body:

```python
self.trigger("ro")
```

Mark the pulse that is measured and demodulated with `readout=True`:

```python
self.add_pulse(
    "readout",
    gen="res",
    style="const",
    length=1 * us,
    frequency=cfg["f_res"],
    gain=0.02,
    readout=True,
)
```

For a tagged readout pulse, the compiler creates the marker from that pulse
only. By default the marker begins `500 ns` before the pulse and ends `500 ns`
after it. If the pulse starts too early to provide the requested pre-padding,
the compiler shifts the entire shot later while preserving all relative pulse
timing. `self.trigger("ro")` then uses the marker padding as the initial ATS
post-trigger delay. Pass `trigger_delay=...` explicitly after measuring the
actual hardware time of flight.

Programs without a tagged readout pulse retain the older behavior: the
compiler uses `waveform_ch` as the marker reference and finds that channel's
active waveform interval.
For a marker fixed at the beginning of every sequence step, use
`marker_length=40 * ns` instead of `waveform_ch`.
`trigger_delay` configures how long ATS9371 waits after receiving the marker
before acquisition begins. The hardware delay must be identical for every
sequence step.

When `compiled.acquire(...)` starts, its compatibility wrapper delegates to
`AWGAlazar`. The coordinator applies the ADC channel, demodulation frequency,
trigger delay, and integration time to the ATS9371, uploads the compiled AWG
sequence when needed, and collects the result.
`integrate_time` averages IQ from the beginning of the acquired trace; it must
fit inside both the readout length and hardware acquisition window.

It intentionally resembles QICK's program style:

```python
class MyProgram(ExperimentProgram):
    def _initialize(self, cfg):
        ...

    def _body(self, cfg):
        ...
```

The execution model is different from FPGA firmware. Sweeps are expanded at
compile time into AWG waveform assets and sequence-list steps. ATS records are
captured in the same interleaved order and reshaped using the compiler's record
layout.

## Data contract

The only acquisition averaging parameter is `n_average`:

```python
result = compiled.acquire(n_average=1000)
```

For `P` sequence points, the result keeps the unaveraged records:

```python
result.raw.shape
# (n_average, P, adc_sample)

result.iq_traces.shape
# (n_average, P, iq_sample)

result.shots("ro").shape
# (n_average, P)
```

Averaging is explicit:

```python
raw_average = result.trace_average("ro")
iq_trace_average = result.iq_trace_average("ro")
iq_average = result.iq_average("ro")
```

This is important for single-shot experiments because the compiler does not
discard shot-level information.

## Basic program

```python
from QAWG import ExperimentProgram, LinearSweep, MHz, ns, us


class SpectroscopyProgram(ExperimentProgram):
    def _initialize(self, cfg):
        self.declare_gen("qubit", ch=4, amplitude_vpp=0.5)
        self.declare_gen("res", ch=3, amplitude_vpp=0.5)

        self.declare_readout(
            "ro",
            adc_channel="CHA",
            length=1 * us,
            demod_freq=cfg["f_res"],
            waveform_ch=3,
            marker_channel=1,
            integrate_time=800 * ns,
        )

        frequency = self.add_sweep(
            "frequency",
            LinearSweep(2920 * MHz, 3000 * MHz, 101),
        )

        self.add_pulse(
            "probe",
            gen="qubit",
            style="const",
            length=15 * us,
            frequency=frequency,
            gain=0.01,
        )
        self.add_pulse(
            "readout",
            gen="res",
            style="const",
            length=2 * us,
            frequency=cfg["f_res"],
            gain=0.02,
            readout=True,
        )

    def _body(self, cfg):
        self.play("probe", at=0)
        self.play("readout", at=0)
        self.trigger("ro")
```

Compile without hardware to inspect generated assets:

```python
program = SpectroscopyProgram(
    {"f_res": 50 * MHz},
    final_delay_s=1 * us,
)

compiled = program.compile(sample_rate_hz=2.5e9)
frequencies = compiled.axis("frequency")
qubit_steps = compiled.preview(channel=4)
```

Compile and bind to an existing `AWGAlazar` instance:

```python
compiled = program.compile(hardware=experiment)
result = compiled.acquire(n_average=1000)
```

To remove one constant DC offset from every acquired trace before
downconversion and integration:

```python
program.REMOVE_DC_OFFSET = True
compiled = program.compile(hardware=experiment)
```

This subtracts each trace's full-record mean independently.

## Relative timing

`play()` without `at` advances a program cursor:

```python
self.play("pi")
self.delay_auto(40 * ns)
self.play("readout")
self.trigger("ro")
```

This compiles to:

```text
pi pulse -> 40 ns delay -> readout + marker
```

Explicit `at` allows overlapping pulses:

```python
self.play("probe", at=0)
self.play("readout", at=0)
self.trigger("ro", trigger_delay=650 * ns)
```

Here `at` controls pulse placement. The marker follows the active waveform on
the tagged readout pulse; marker padding and `trigger_delay` are applied
relative to that marker.

## Power Rabi

Power Rabi sweeps waveform gain. AWG5208 cannot update an FPGA gain register
per shot, so the compiler renders one waveform asset per gain and places those
assets in the sequence list.

```python
from QAWG import PowerRabiProgram

program = PowerRabiProgram({
    "f_res": 50e6,
    "f_ge": 100e6,
    "gain_start": 0.0,
    "gain_stop": 0.1,
    "steps": 51,
    "qubit_len": 100 * ns,
    "qubit_sigma": 15 * ns,
    "res_len": 1 * us,
    "res_gain": 0.02,
    "ro_len": 1 * us,
})

compiled = program.compile(hardware=experiment)
result = compiled.acquire(n_average=1000)

gain = result.axis("gain")
iq = result.iq_average("ro")
```

## T1

T1 sweeps `delay_auto()` between the pi pulse and readout. Every compiled
sequence step is padded to the same total duration, so trigger cadence does not
depend on the delay value.

```python
from QAWG import T1Program

program = T1Program({
    "f_res": 50e6,
    "f_ge": 100e6,
    "delay_start": 0,
    "delay_stop": 100 * us,
    "steps": 101,
    "pi_len": 100 * ns,
    "pi_sigma": 15 * ns,
    "pi_gain": 0.02,
    "res_len": 1 * us,
    "res_gain": 0.02,
    "ro_len": 1 * us,
})

result = program.compile(hardware=experiment).acquire(n_average=1000)
delay = result.axis("delay")
iq = result.iq_average("ro")
```

## Single shot

Single-shot calibration uses a categorical `state` axis. The `g` step skips
the pi pulse; the `e` step plays it.

```python
from QAWG import SingleShotProgram

compiled = SingleShotProgram(cfg).compile(hardware=experiment)
result = compiled.acquire(n_average=10_000)

states = result.axis("state")
shots = result.shots("ro")

ground = shots[:, 0]
excited = shots[:, 1]
```

No automatic average is performed by `shots()`.

## Current limits

- Sweeps are compile-time AWG sequence expansion, not FPGA runtime loops.
- Programs without sweeps still use the same backend as a one-step AWG
  sequence. This keeps upload, acquisition, and result shapes consistent.
- The current backend supports one readout named `"ro"`.
- The compiler produces a hardware-independent plan. Hardware upload and
  acquisition execution are owned by `AWGAlazar`.
- Sweep axes use Cartesian expansion when more than one axis is declared.
- Conditional playback currently supports equality checks such as
  `when=("state", "e")`.
- Waveform upload caching and sequence chunking are future optimizations.
- Hardware acquisition requires an already configured `AWGAlazar` instance
  whose sample rates and readout settings match the compiled program.
